                                 <h2>DWARF</h2>
                                 <p>The dwarves are a stoic but tough race, settled in cities dug in the heart of the mountains and fiercely determined to repel the ravages of savage races like orcs and goblins. More than any other race, the dwarves have a reputation for being the most stubborn and with the least sense of humor of all the creatures that work the land. Arguably, its history has always been tied to the dark disposition of many dwarves to reside in high mountains or dangerous underground kingdoms, and to their constant warfare with giants, goblins, and other equally horrendous creatures.                                     
                                 </p>
                                 <p><strong>Physical description:</strong> Dwarves are a small and somewhat stocky race, and are about a foot shorter than most humans, possessing a large build and width that give them a portly appearance. Both men and women pride themselves on the length of their hair, and men often adorn their beards with a variety of intricate hooks and ties. A shaven dwarf is undoubtedly a sign of madness, indeed, no one who is familiar with his breed will ever trust a dwarf without a beard.
                                 </p>
                                 <p><strong>Society:</strong> the great distances between their cities under the mountains explain many of the differences that exist within their own society. Despite these differences, dwarves around the world are characterized by their devotion to stonework, their passion for stone (and metal) -based constructions and architecture, and their fierce hatred of giants, orcs. and goblin creatures. 
                                 </p>
                                 <p><strong>Relations:</strong> Dwarves and orcs have always lived in close proximity to each other, their history of violence is as old as their own races. Dwarves generally distrust and avoid half orcs. They find halflings, elves, and gnomes too fragile, peaceful, and pretty to be respected. It is with human beings that they maintain their strongest bond, mainly due to the industrious nature of humans and their good appetite, both qualities very close to their own ideals. 
                                 </p>
                                 <p><strong>Alignment and Religion:</strong> Dwarves are guided by honor and their traditions, and although some frequently lampoon them as distant creatures, they possess a strong sense of friendship and justice, and those who are worthy of their trust know that, while they work hard, they can still show. tougher - especially if there's a good mug of beer at stake. Most dwarves are good legal. They prefer to worship deities whose principles match these traits; Perhaps Torag is a favorite among the dwarves, though Abadar and Gorum are also often common choices. 
                                 </p>
                                 <p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Although adventurous dwarves are rare compared to humans, they can be seen almost everywhere in the world. Dwarves frequently leave the confines of their territories in search of glory for their clans, to find treasures with which to enrich their native homes, or to claim dwarf cities fallen to the hands of their racial enemies. Their fighting mode is characterized above all by close combat and close combat, which is why most tend towards barbarian or warrior classes.
