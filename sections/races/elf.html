                                 <p>Long-lived Elves are children of the natural world, similar in many superficial ways to magical creatures (such as fairies), but at the same time they are also different. They value their intimacy and traditions, and while they take the time to forge friendships, both personally and with other races, once an outsider is accepted as a comrade, their alliance can last for generations. Elves have a curious attachment to everything around them, perhaps as a result of their incredible longevity or, in a deeper sense, for some mystical reason. Those who live in the same region for a long time end up physically adapting to their environment, most of the time this results in a coloration on the skin that reflects the environment around them. On the other hand, elves who spend their lives surrounded by less long-lived races, frequently develop a skewed perception of mortality and become taciturn, it is the result of seeing the lives of their companions pass before their eyes again and again.
                                 </p>
                                 <p><strong>Physical description:</strong> Although generally taller than humans, elves possess a grace and physical fragility that is accentuated by their long, pointed ears. His eyes are wide and almond-shaped, inside large pupils of bright colors can be seen. Although they often dress playing with the beauty of their surroundings, it is not uncommon to see those who live in cities dressing up to date.
                                 </p>
                                 <p><strong>Society:</strong> Many elves feel a bond with nature and strive to live in harmony with the natural world. The vast majority, however, find the manipulation of earth and stone distasteful, preferring instead to inquire into more refined arts, especially thanks to their innate patience which makes them particularly apt for magic.
                                 </p>
                                 <p><strong>Relations:</strong> Elves are prone to reject other races, calling them reckless and impulsive, yet they are good at judging people. An elf may not want a dwarf for a neighbor, but he would be the first to recognize his talent for smithing. They regard gnomes as strangely (and sometimes dangerously) curious beings, and feel a certain pity for halflings, in the eyes of the elves these little creatures appear to be adrift, homeless. Elves are fascinated with humans, as evidenced by the large number of demi-elves in the world, even though they usually deny such offspring. They regard half-orcs as unreliable and suspicious creatures.
                                 </p>
                                 <p><strong>Alignment and Religion:</strong> Elves are emotional and capricious, they value goodness and beauty. The vast majority are chaotic good. They prefer deities who share their love for the mystical qualities of the world Desna and Nethys are often their favorites, the former for their admiration and passion for the wilderness, the latter for their mastery of magic. Calistra is perhaps the most notable of the elven deities, for she represents the highest elven ideals taken to the extreme.
                                 </p>
                                 <p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Many elves go on adventures with the desire to explore the world, leaving their isolated forest kingdoms to retrieve forgotten elven magic or to search for lost kingdoms that were created millennia ago by their ancestors. For those who have grown up among human beings, the fleeting and unfettered life of an adventurer has a natural appeal. Elves, in general, avoid melee due to its fragility, preferring instead to follow other classes such as wizard and ranger.
