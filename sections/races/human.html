                                <h2>HUMAN</h2>
                                <p>Humans possess extraordinary drive and a great capacity to resist and expand, therefore they are the dominant race in the world. Their empires and nations are vast, growing out of control, and the inhabitants of these societies make a name for themselves with the strength of their swords and the power of their spells. Humanity is defined above all by its tumultuousness and diversity, and its civilization ranges from the savage but honorable tribes to the decadent and evil noble families in the most cosmopolitan cities. Human curiosity and ambition frequently trump their predisposition for a more sedentary lifestyle, and many leave their homes to explore countless forgotten parts of the world or to enlist in powerful armies to invade their neighbors, simply because they can.</p>
                                <p><strong>Physical description:</strong> The physical characteristics of humans are as varied as the world's climates. From the dark skinned tribes of the southern continents to the pale barbarian invaders of the northern lands, humans possess a variety of skin colors, body shapes, and facial features. Generally speaking, human skin color assumes a darker appearance as we get closer to the equator where they live. 
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Sociedad:</strong> Human society comprises a large number of governments, positions, and lifestyles. Although the history of the oldest human civilizations dating back thousands of years, when compared to the civilizations of other common races such as elves and dwarves, human society seems to be in constant flux with empires falling and new ones emerging. they supplant them. In general, humans are known for their flexibility, naivety, and ambition. 
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Relations:</strong> Humans are fertile, and their unity and numbers make them frequently come into contact with other races during periods of territorial expansion and colonization. In many cases this leads to war and violence, yet humans are also quick to forgive and forge alliances with races that do not try to equal or exceed them in violence. Proud, sometimes to the point of arrogance, humans can come to see dwarves as miserable drunks, elves as frivolous petty bosses, halflings as cowardly thieves, gnomes as twisted maniacs, and half-elves. and half-orcs as a disgrace but the racial diversity among their members also makes humans quite predisposed to accept others whoever they may be.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Alignment and Religion:</strong> Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the common races, with the capacity for unimaginable evil or infinite goodness. Some join the huge barbarian hordes, while others build huge cities several miles long. As a whole, most are neutral, although they tend to congregate in regions and civilizations with specific alignments. Humans also have the widest range of gods and religions, lack ties to the traditions of other races, and are willing to choose whoever offers them glory or protection. They have even adopted gods like Torag or Calistria, who for millennia were more identified with the older races, and as humanity continues to grow and prosper, new gods have begun to emerge from ever-expanding myths and legends.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Ambition alone can guide large numbers of human beings, and for many, adventure serves as a means to an end, be it wealth, ambition, social status, or arcane knowledge. Some seek a life of adventure simply for the thrill of danger. Humans come from multiple regions and environments, and as such they can take on any role in an adventurer group.
